Problem statement:
we found that one of the major problem with last mile delivery is that some of the new ground pilots are un aware of the locality while 
delivering,some orders just have location description but not coordinates, so the pilot keeps on disturbing the customer for the address.
Customers hate to have this conversations where they call 10 times to get to the right place.

Solution: 
The team has concentrated in solving the issues faced by ground pilot while giving a delivery.The System is designed such a way that it
Provides real time order information. In the case of the delivery person not Able to find the delivery point or the pick up point there
Would be a service person who would capture the current location of the pilot and provide him the path. When the delivery is completed  
he would be advised of the next pick up point on basis of the current location there by maintaining  continuous flow. This saves time 
and fuel consumption and therefore cost of delivery is reduced.

Assumptions:
Due to lack of time, we mocked the communication between the server and the pilot app.
